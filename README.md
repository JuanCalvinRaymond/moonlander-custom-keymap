# moonlander-custom-keymap
My custom keymap and macro for ZSA's moonlander that helps me game and code better.


# Custom capability:
* Detect layer change and enable/disable combo functionality so it works while coding but not while gaming.
* Layer dedicated for C++ specific syntax ex. (->, ++, ==)

# Future:
* Extend layer detection to auto shift.
